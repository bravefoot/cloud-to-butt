butt-to-butt-extreme
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'your butt' with 'your butt'

This version is based on the github version, and not the Google Chrome Store version, wich means it changes the word butt in all contexts, and not just computing contexts.

I felt that "your butt" was a better option than "my butt," so I adjusted the code to do accordinly. I also decided to go with the more childish change of having it change all instances of the word butt, and not just "your butt." 

What makes it extreme?
It also makes an "! (that's what she said) (that's what she said)" imply that she said the previous sentence.
We also added a data-to-poop functionality
