cloud-to-butt-extreme
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'the cloud' with 'your butt'

[Direct download of crx file](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt/blob/master/CloudToButt.crx?raw=true)

This version is based on the github version, and not the Google Chrome Store version, wich means it changes the word cloud in all contexts, and not just computing contexts.

I felt that "your butt" was a better option than "my butt," so I adjusted the code to do accordinly. I also decided to go with the more childish change of having it change all instances of the word cloud, and not just "the cloud." 

What makes it extreme?
It also makes an "!" imply that she said the previous sentence.
